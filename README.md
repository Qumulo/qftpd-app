##An FTP server for Qumulo's REST API

###by Mike Bott <mbott@qumulo.com>

This FTP server runs against Qumulo's REST API, providing an FTP interface to QSFS. It uses the RestClient for
everything up to and including authorization.

### HOWTO:

Install dependencies with pip:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Edit qftpd.py to match your Qumulo cluster's config:

```python
# Qumulo RESTful API admin address/port and credentials
"""There is at least one call that needs to be performed in an admin context (need to get cluster config stuff to
display welcome message, for example).
"""
API_HOST = '192.168.11.147'
API_PORT = '8000'
API_USER = 'admin'
API_PASS = 'a'
```

Edit qftpd.py to match your local timezone settings:

```python
# For dealing with timestamps
LOCAL_TZ = 'America/Los_Angeles'
```

Run qftpd.py as root (it needs to bind to a privileged port):

```
mbottMBP:qftpd mbott$ sudo python qftpd.py
Password:
[I 15-06-16 14:28:55] >>> starting FTP server on 127.0.0.1:21, pid=30863 <<<
[I 15-06-16 14:28:55] poller: <class 'pyftpdlib.ioloop.Kqueue'>
[I 15-06-16 14:28:55] masquerade (NAT) address: None
[I 15-06-16 14:28:55] passive ports: None
[I 15-06-16 14:28:55] use sendfile(2): True
```

Connect to the FTP server with proper credentials for a local Qumulo user and use cd, put, and get like normal:

```
mbottMBP:~ mbott$ ftp localhost
